# Option_Thesis

This R script eventually to be port to CUDA 
Reads in ~1200 equites in the csv file across multiple categories and looks at the standard deviation of equities over the last 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years. Afterwards for each of the different time steps it trucates the 50 least volitile equities. Eventually it will be used to look at viable iron condor strategies after backtesting.
